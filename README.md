# Anna
This is a Hackathon project for E.C. Jamming 2017 (http://ecjamming.tech/) with the theme: campus life. Anna is an intelligent Chatbot that brings students with similar intrests and needs together as intrest groups and short-term gatherings.

## Actual product and desgin explaination
![Actual Facebook Messenger](https://github.com/a2975667/Anna/blob/master/document/1.jpg)

This screenshot shows the end-product we design. It aims to help identify quick group gatherings such as:
- finding friends to buy 1 get 1
- creating interest groups
- create meetups that expires shortly

We believe that it serves a different audience than social media groups that tend to last longer.
